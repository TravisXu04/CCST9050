      <h2>Phenomenon in restaurants, especially fast-food</h2>
      <p>
        McDonald's, a leading fast-food chain, recently announced its plan to
        replace its human workforce with robots in all its restaurants by 2040.
        McDonald's is a pioneer in staffing innovation, introducing automatic
        ordering systems and mechanizing food preparation jobs. As of the first
        day of 2040, the final human employee at McDonald's had retired. We are
        privileged to present an exclusive interview with him. There are some
        highlights:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Interviewer:</b> How did you feel when you heard the announcement
        from McDonald’s?
        <br />
        <b>Leo:</b> I was so shocked when I found out that McDonald’s was firing
        all the humans. It was a roller coaster of emotions. I felt proud that I
        had seen so much change, but also kind of sad that it was the end of
        something amazing. I thought back to how it all began, with those touch
        screens for ordering and then the machines taking over the kitchens. It
        was amazing how far we had come. It was the end of an era where people
        worked at a fast-food place like McDonald’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Interviewer:</b> Can you elaborate on how machines are gradually
        replacing human jobs?
        <br />
        <b>Leo:</b> Absolutely. The transition began with the introduction of
        new ordering systems. Customers were given the option to place their
        orders either through their phones or via machines installed within the
        restaurants. This was followed by the deployment of robots that roamed
        the restaurant, collecting and cleaning trays. Next, we saw the
        implementation of packing machines, designed to efficiently package food
        into their respective containers. The final phase of this transformation
        was marked by the development and distribution of fully automated food
        processors across all our restaurants.

      <p>
        Many fast-food chains, following McDonald's lead in using robots, have
        adopted automation, signaling a widespread trend in the restaurant
        industry. Looking beyond fast food, we find that many other restaurants
        have incorporated different amounts of automation. Even in smaller
        establishments with limited automation, machines such as dishwashers and
        food preparation equipment are now common. This shift is reflected in
        the fewer humans present in modern kitchens. Our observations were
        supported by our surveys, and the results are as follows:

      <h2>The Truth Behind the Phenomenon</h2>
      <p>
        Several factors drive the growing trend of restaurants adopting robotic
        technology to replace human labor. This section will explore some
        possible key dimensions of this trend.
      </p>
      <h4>Cost</h4>
      <p>
        The initial cost of machines is noticeably lower than hiring human
        employees, especially when considering the costs of onboarding,
        training, and benefits. Human employees may require several months to
        become productive members of the team, while machines can be operational
        with a trained AI model or programmed software. During the training
        process, there is a high probability that employees will decide for
        themselves to leave their jobs, in particular those who work in
        stressful environments like kitchens. This can lead to substantial cost
        savings for restaurants, especially in the early stages of growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Machine maintenance costs are also significantly lower than hiring human
        employees, due to several factors. First, regular machines can operate
        for at least three to five years without major issues, resulting in
        extremely low maintenance costs over time. Second, machines may only
        require a biannual or annual inspection which is considerably less
        expensive than that required by employees who need monthly salaries.
        Third, machines can work without limitations, while employers must
        comply with labor laws and provide certain benefits to human employees,
        such as paid time off, health insurance, and retirement contributions.
        These additional costs can add up significantly over time.
      </p>
      <h4>Efficiency and Quality</h4>
      <p>
        Machines can work significantly more efficiently than humans, as they do
        not require rest and can operate 24/7. This is a major advantage in the
        restaurant industry, where work is often strenuous, and employees need
        frequent breaks. The balance between quality and quantity is a challenge
        for human beings, which can affect customer experience importantly. In
        contrast, machines can maintain a high level of quality even in harsh
        environments with long hours and heavy workloads. In addition, these
        machines shall strictly comply with the restaurant's instructions which
        will allow it to ensure complete hygiene and reflect its true quality.
      </p>
      <h2>Impacts of the phenomenon</h2>
      <p>
        In the previous section, our focus was primarily on the reasons
        prompting restaurants to introduce these changes. Now, let us delve into
        the consequential impacts that these changes have on other stakeholders.
      </p>
      <h4>Positive Impacts</h4>
      <p>
        While it is apparent that the implementation of robotic technology
        brings benefits to restaurants, its positive impact extends to consumers
        as well. As previously mentioned, the significant cost reduction for
        restaurants can lead to lower prices for consumers. Take McDonald's, for
        instance. Despite inflationary pressures, the price of the perennial
        favorite, the Big Mac, has remained consistent over the past two
        decades. Here are some related statistics:
      </p>
      <img src="images/3.png" />
      <p>
        Despite the price decrease, both the speed and quality of service have
        witnessed a remarkable improvement. Burger King, a fast-food restaurant
        highly integrated with robotic technology, develops an elaborate grading
        system for burgers. This system evaluates various criteria, including
        source distribution, filling ratio, and overall shape, assigning grades
        ranging from 0 to 100. Using this system, Burger King grades different
        burger restaurants and creates a report in 2038. Results indicate that,
        although most restaurants employing robotic technology have a relatively
        lower average score than those relying purely on human labor, the scores
        are more centralized. To express this mathematically, the standard
        deviation of scores from modern burger restaurants is only 3.25,
        significantly lower than the 14.31 observed in traditional restaurants.
        Beyond quality metrics, the report also explores the time required for
        restaurants to prepare their signature dishes. Unsurprisingly, modern
        restaurants outpace traditional restaurants, completing the process
        nearly three times faster. In summary, as consumers, we stand to benefit
        from lower prices, enhanced quality, and expedited service in these
        modernized restaurants.
      </p>
      <h4>Negative Impacts</h4>
      <p>
        Every innovation entails costs. Although it has obvious benefits for the
        restaurant sector, there are fundamental drawbacks that require careful
        consideration and proactive measures to mitigate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        First and most obviously, restaurant automation raises the unemployment
        rate. According to the statistics from Statista (2022), there were
        approximately 12.5 million people employed in the restaurant industry in
        the United States in 2022. However, as estimated by Allie in 2038, this
        figure has dropped to only 1.6 million. Even with a population growth of
        about 26 million in the U.S., it is resulting in a shocking 87% decline.
        The unemployment rate in the US is also reflected in this situation.
        Government data reveals a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.6% in
        2022 to 9.8% in 2039. Although this may not be entirely down to the
        automation in restaurants, it is one of the main factors. Similar
        situations have been observed globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, it also homogenizes the restaurant industry. While the cost of
        the food processors decreases over time, it is still costly for an
        independent restaurant to design and maintain its processors.
        Consequently, the majority of restaurants are forced to use the same
        generic processors, which are very limited in their ability to customize
        them. That makes independent restaurants extremely challenging to
        separate themselves from their competitor. On the other side, the large
        chain restaurants can afford to design and develop their custom
        processors that are optimized for them. This allows them to make dishes
        that are more unique and complicated which widens the gap between
        independent and chain restaurants, forming a vicious circle. This
        situation has also been documented by Statista (2039), which includes
        the following statistics:
      </p>
      <img src="images/4.png" />
      <p>
        Finally, the restaurant industry may face a downturn. In the previous
        section, we've mentioned how the costs of food processors have been
        reduced over time. For certain families, it has become more and more
        cost-effective to have one at home. Some producers see this as a future
        trend and are already taking steps towards the development of cheaper,
        smaller, but feature-rich, fully automated food processors. It
        encourages people to take a closer look at buying it. We can see that,
        in the next couple of years, it could be a part of every household's
        electrical appliance. For the restaurant, this is a serious threat.
      </p>
      <h2>Potential solutions for these drawbacks</h2>
      <p>
        The escalation of the unemployment rate has appeared as a significant
        concern in certain countries. Proposals supporting the prohibition of
        fully automated robotic technology in restaurants, together with the
        requirement to hire human employees, have been put out as a
        straightforward solution with the potential to substantially boost
        employment in the short term. However, this approach fails to address
        underlying issues. Another suggestion involves the implementation of
        copyright protection for cooking recipes. These recipes, different from
        traditional ones, are encrypted, and understandable only to food
        processors. In this imagined future, restaurants may abandon the
        responsibility of food preparation and instead sell digital cooking
        recipes to consumers. In the future, we may not have physical
        restaurants because the recipe has been digitized which means all our
        food can be purchased online. Nevertheless, this innovation does not
        resolve the persisting issue of high unemployment rates. The quest for
        optimal solutions continues, and we remain hopeful that future
        innovations will yield more effective resolutions to these challenges.

        As an independent restaurant owner, I'm kind of lost on what moves to
        make next. I mean, using those fully automated machines feels like we're
        losing the heart and soul of our dishes. But, you know, every joint is
        jumping on the automation bandwagon, and human labor costs are shooting
        through the roof these days. I gotta bring in some automation to keep
        the prices in check, but some of our regulars are not vibing with it.
        They say the dishes have lost that special something.

        I'm not feeling the idea of banning the automated gizmos, though. We
        shouldn't be putting the brakes on tech progress. What if the government
        cut us some slack, like giving a break on hiring humans, you know? That
        way, we'd be more up for hiring folks and keeping the food unique.

        For those digital cooking recipes, I'm not exactly tech-savvy, so I
        can't dive too deep into it. But I'd be excited to see that happen if it
        were real. I love coming up with new recipes. That's the whole reason I
        opened this restaurant. If these digital recipes become a thing, I could
        focus on the fun side of cooking rather than worry about running this
        place. Sounds like a win-win to me.

        As a normal consumer, I don’t see a big difference between human-made
        and robot-made food. If I'd had a chance to pick one, it would have been
        the robot-made meals as they were cheaper, faster, and tasted like food
        from humans. However, the food is indeed getting kinda homogenized. A
        while back, I ordered two the same dishes in two different restaurants,
        and it struck me how menus are starting to blend. It’s getting
        challenging to find something special to chow down on.
